Create the Lambda Function
Step 1: Open Lambda
AWS Console → Search Lambda → Open AWS Lambda
Step 2: Create function
Click Create function
Select - Author from scratch
Function name: StudentGradeLogger
Runtime: Python 3.11
Architecture: x86_64 (default)
Step 3: Permissions (Execution Role)
Under “Permissions”
Choose: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions
This automatically gives permission to write logs to CloudWatch.
Click Create function



Add Code (Business Logic + Logs)
Step 4: Paste this code
In Code tab → lambda_function.py → paste and Deploy
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Welcome message
    print("Lambda invoked successfully")

    # Read input from event
    student_name = event["StudentName"]
    marks = event["Marks"]

    # Business logic: grade calculation
    if marks >= 75:
        result = "Pass"
        grade = "A"
    else:
        result = "Fail"
        grade = "F"

    # Log output
    print("Student:", student_name)
    print("Marks:", marks)
    print("Grade:", grade)
    print("Result:", result)

    # Return response
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "StudentName": student_name,
            "Marks": marks,
            "Grade": grade,
            "Result": result
        })
    }
Click Deploy.



Test with Input Events (JSON)
Step 5: Create a test event (Valid case)
Go to Test (top right) → Configure test event
Event name: ValidInput
Paste this JSON:
{
  "StudentName": "Anita",
  "Marks": 86
}
Click Save


Step 6: Run test
Click Test
Expected response (sample):
statusCode: 200
body will include Grade A and Result Pass


Step 7: Test invalid input (Missing Marks)
Create another test event:
Event name: MissingMarks
{
  "StudentName": "Rahul"
}
Run Test
Expected:
statusCode: 400
message: Missing 'Marks'


Step 8: Test invalid marks range
Event name: InvalidMarks
{
  "StudentName": "Priya",
  "Marks": 150
}
Expected:
statusCode: 400
message: Marks must be 0–100

View Logs in CloudWatch
Step 9: Open logs from Lambda directly
On the Lambda function page:
Go to Monitor tab
Click View CloudWatch logs
You will see:
Log group: /aws/lambda/StudentGradeLogger
Open latest log stream
You should see all print() outputs:
“Lambda invoked successfully!”
“Received event…”
grade/result logs
error logs for invalid tests

Cleanup (Avoid charges, keep account clean)
Lambda itself usually costs nothing in small use, but cleanup is good practice:
Lambda → Functions → select StudentGradeLogger → Delete
CloudWatch → Log groups → find /aws/lambda/StudentGradeLogger → Delete
IAM role created (optional):
IAM → Roles → search role name created for Lambda → delete (only if not used elsewhere)
