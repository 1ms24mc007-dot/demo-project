Phase 1: Create DynamoDB Table
Create a DynamoDB table to store Student Records.
Store items like: USN, Name, Semester, Course, Attendance, IA1Marks

Step 1: Open DynamoDB
Login to AWS Console
Search → type DynamoDB → open Amazon DynamoDB
Step 2: Create a Table
Left menu → Tables
Click Create table
Fill details:
Table details
Table name: MCA_StudentLabInternals
Partition key (PK): USN (Type: String)
Sort key (SK): CourseCode (Type: String)
(Enable sort key option by setting sort key)
Why this design?
One student can have multiple courses → Sort key separates records per course.
This creates a composite primary key (PK + SK).
Step 3: Table settings
Under Table settings, choose:
Default settings (recommended for lab)
Ensure Capacity mode is: On-demand (default already selected)
Step 4: Create
Click Create table
Wait until table status becomes Active

Phase 2: Insert Items (Create Data)
Step 5: Open Table and Add Items
Click the table: MCA_StudentLabInternals
Click: Explore table items
Click Create item

Step 6: Add Item 1 (Student 1 - Course 1)
You will see attributes:
USN (String)
CourseCode (String)
Enter:
USN = 1MS24MCA001
CourseCode = CCL301
Now add additional attributes (click Add new attribute):
Name (String) = Arun
Semester (Number) = 3
Attendance (Number) = 86
IA1Marks (Number) = 18
Click Create item


Step 7: Add Item 2 (Same student - another course)
Repeat Create item with:
USN = 1MS24MCA001
CourseCode = DBS301
Name = Arun
Semester = 3
Attendance = 88
IA1Marks = 20


Step 8: Add Item 3 (Another student)
Create item:
USN = 1MS24MCA002
CourseCode = CCL301
Name = Chitra
Semester = 3
Attendance = 74
IA1Marks = 14
You should now see 3 items in the table list.


Phase 3: Read Data (Get / Query / Scan)
Step 9: Get a single item (exact PK + SK)
In “Explore table items”, use search/filter:
Use USN = 1MS24MC001 and CourseCode = CCL301
Open the item → verify all attributes
Key concept:
To uniquely identify an item in a PK+SK table, you must provide both.



Step 10: Query – fetch all courses for one student
Click Run query
Set Partition key condition: USN equals 1MS24MCA001
Run
Expected output:
Items for Arun in both CCL301 and DBS301
Key concept:
Query works only with Partition Key (and optional Sort Key conditions). It is efficient.


Step 11: Scan (Not for large tables)
Click Scan
Run scan without filters
Expected output:
All items (Arun + Chitra)
Key concept:
Scan reads the entire table → slow/costly for big tables.


Phase 4: Update Data
Step 12: Update IA1 marks of Chitra for CCL301
Open item where:
USN = 1MS24MCA002
CourseCode = CCL301
Click Edit
Change: IA1Marks from 14 to 16
Click Save changes
Verify updated value appears.


Phase 5: Delete Data
Step 13: Delete one item (Arun’s DBS301 record)
Select item:
USN = 1MS24MCA001
CourseCode = DBS301
Click Delete
Confirm delete
Now total items should reduce by 1.


Phase 6: Cleanup (Must Do to avoid charges)
Step 15: Delete the Table
DynamoDB → Tables
Select MCA_StudentLabInternals
Click Delete
Type confirmation (if asked) and delete
Ensure table disappears from list.
